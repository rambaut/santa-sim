= Introduction =

This is an internal page used to keep track of things to be done to get a first release out.

= Name =

We need a good name (*Beth*, *Andrew*, *Koen*)

= Code =

 * Update schema (*Andrew?*)
 * Phylogeny sampling (*Andrew*)
 * Package, license, INSTALL.txt, README.txt, ... (*Koen*)
 * Examples (*Koen*)

= Documentation =

List of things we may not forget to document in the on-line reference manual (*Koen*)

 * Parameters
 * Replicates
 * Genome description (length, features, 'example' sequences)
 * Sampling schedule, event logger, and default (mutator, replicator & fitness function)
 * Epochs which may override any of (mutator, replicator & fitness function)
 * Fitness factor id's and ref's, and why ?
 * Complicated purifying fitness function
 * Format of sequence alignments (FASTA or plain)
 * Variables in samplers (%g, %r, %s)

= Manuscript =

 * *Koen* is updating the Introduction, Implementation & Methods section to reflect the current features (OK).
 * Waiting for simulations and results until the phylogeny is implemented.
